#Project Goal:
To create a dynamic and insightful Power BI dashboard that provides real-time visibility into the current status and progress of projects managed within Azure DevOps Boards.

# Data Source: 
  Azure DevOps Boards (Work Items)

# Target Audience: 
  Project Managers, Team Leads, Stakeholders, and Development Teams.

# Key Objectives:

Real-time Project Tracking: Provide up-to-date information on project progress, task completion, and potential roadblocks.
Performance Monitoring: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as burndown rates, lead/cycle times, and task completion rates.
Risk Identification: Highlight potential risks and bottlenecks based on data analysis.
Improved Communication: Facilitate clear and concise communication of project status to all stakeholders.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Enable data-driven decisions by providing actionable insights.
Dashboard Components (Potential):

# Project Overview:
Overall project status (e.g., On Track, At Risk, Delayed)
Percentage completion
Remaining work
Start and end dates
Completed vs. Remaining work in the current sprint

# Team Performance:
Team velocity and throughput
Individual workload distribution
Task completion rate by team member.
Filters and Slicers:
Project selection
Work item type selection
Team member selection
Date range selection.

# Technical Considerations:

Azure DevOps API Integration: Utilize the Azure DevOps REST API to extract data into Power BI.
Data Transformation and Modeling: Clean, transform, and model the extracted data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
DAX Calculations: Implement DAX calculations to derive relevant metrics and KPIs.
Visualizations: Create interactive and informative visualizations using Power BI's built-in charts and graphs.
Data Refresh: Configure automatic data refresh to ensure the dashboard reflects the latest information.
Security: Implement appropriate security measures to control access to the dashboard.
